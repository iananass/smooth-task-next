NEW: exposing fps setting in UI
FIX: fixed crash when using wheel on tooltip (in rare cases)

wip 2009-09-02:
NEW: more 'smooth' animated manual task sorting. This uses QTimer for the
animation because I find Plasma::Animator much to limited to do such an
animation. I hope kinetic will be more convenient.
FIX: fixed a rare crash. let's hope I didn't introduce a new one.
NEW: now you can scroll the text on animated text labels per dragging it.
just in case it scrolls to fast/slow for your taste.
NEW: implemented scrolling of tooltip on mouse wheel when the preview is
outside of the screen. thanks to ssri for noticing this.
Improvement:
Tooltips should now be a bit better glued to their task items.

vertical ordering of tooltip in vertical form factors

FIX: reworked tooltip movement (still not perfect on short animation duration)
FIX: improved tooltip placement, thanks to Michal Odstrčil
NEW: implemented D'n'D to tooltips. however, sometimes this gets stuck and I have no idea why.
HACK: it seems like the pager does not support drops of task groups so only drop the first task of the group
FIX: fixed scrolling over tooltips that didn't work together with normal hovering

wip 2009-08-23a:
FIX: hopefully fixed tooltip bug which was introduced in the last version

wip 2009-08-23:

mouse wheel to switch through window previews

added cmake requires for KDE4Workspace

FIX: tooltip stealing on window title change bug

wip 2009-08-20:

REMOVED: "Show Border Around Window Previews" options (always show it)

wip 2009-08-19:
NEW: highlight hovered previews
NEW: right click for context menu on previews. for some reason the 'crash on
right click' bug disappeared with this change.

Renamed to Smooth Tasks. :)
A lot of refactoring (now I'm using namespaces).
NEW: close icon is only shown when hovering the corresponding preview
NEW: transitions between close icons visual states (hidden, shown, highlighted)
are now animated

wip 2009-08-17:
FIX: hopefully really fixing tooltip placement issues on multihead systems

wip 2009-08-16:
FIX: probably fixed another rare crash on exit. this occurs when the tooltip
is already deleted but the task items aren't (they access the tooltip in their
destructor)

wip 2009-08-15:
FIX: fixed layout spacing
Improvements:
faster scroll back of the text when stopping hovering
delete previews when tooltip is hidden

wip 2009-08-14:
FIX: tooltips for starting tasks
NEW: resize previews when their windows are resized. I don't know if I keep
this because under some circumstances (showing grouped tooltips for several
automatic and continuous fast resizing windows) this can lock up kwin.

wip 2009-08-13:
some minor improvements on the code (e.g. removed redundancy a bit)

wip 2009-08-12:
NEW: scroll text of labels on mouse-hover when the text is to big for the

wip 2009-08-09:
NEW: update tooltip when task is added/removed
improved layout
made border around previews optional

wip 2009-08-08:
less flicker when moving between tooltip and same task item
NEW: show number of grouped tasks in taskbar item (copied code from KDEs
original taskbar plasmoid)
NEW: window peeking using kwins highlight window effect
NEW: animated scrolling of tooltip when its to big for the screen (move your
cursor to the screen edges)
NEW: tooltip moves animated when moving mouse over taskbar items
KNOWN ISSUE: sometimes when you move the mouse fast over the taskbar items the
tooltip contains garbage
